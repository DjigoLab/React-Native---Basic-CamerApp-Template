# React-Native---Basic-CamerApp-Template
A simple app with a Home screen where you tap a button, and get right into the camera, simple, but you can work over it as a template.

<h2> So, what's this?</h2>

Take it simple, its a basic React Native template I made thinking about an App I'm trying to work on. This one is a home screen, with a background image, where you push a button and takes you into the camera, made by https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera

<h3>Need a hand</h3>
I'd like to refactor the code so I can get the components from the src/components folder, but still working on it, new here! Any help or experiment will be good!
